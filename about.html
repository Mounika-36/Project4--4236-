            <p><h3><em>Styling is a way to present yourself to others in a different and unique manner. It all starts with evaluating someone's figure and silhouette to see which clothes fit best. Good styling helps you shape up your unique identity and your own personal brand which is so important in today's day and age.The profession of a stylist was born in the 1980s and developed in the 1990s when glossy fashion magazines sold very well.Personal stylist brings you an opportunity not only to create for yourself through your perfectly balanced wardrobe but also to save time and money.If you work with your own stylist, you will not have unnecessary things in your wardrobe and an eternal problem of “nothing to wear - nowhere to put” will disappear.  Once you are in love with your own style and fashion, this love lasts forever. Fashion styling is about putting together a whole aesthetic/look for an individual with respect to current trends, personal style, occasion and event.Styling is a way to present yourself to others in a different and unique manner. </em></h3></p> <br> <br>
